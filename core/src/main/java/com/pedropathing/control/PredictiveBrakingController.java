/**
 * A positional controller that maximizes deceleration by measuring the robot’s braking
 * behavior rather than assuming it.
 * <p>
 * Instead of relying on a manually tuned derivative term to prevent overshoot, this
 * controller predicts how far the robot will slide if it brakes using zero-power brake
 * mode. It uses the predicted braking distance to anticipate positional error,
 * effectively treating it as reaction time. This allows the robot to brake precisely
 * when needed, maximizing deceleration, responsiveness, and accuracy.
